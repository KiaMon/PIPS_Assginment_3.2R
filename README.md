# PIPS Assignment 3.2R
This repository contains three functions which represent my answers to PIPS assignments 3.2.1 and 3.2.2. 
## remind_me()

## cheat()

## make_art()
This function only takes a seed number as input. It returns an artwork in the form of an animated plot. The work is titled "The Fly". The make_art function generates a blue plane (the sky), with a black dot (the fly) flying around the space. Setting the seed makes the artwork reproducible, instead of sampling new parameters every time.
