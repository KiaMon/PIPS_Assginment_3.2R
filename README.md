# PIPS Assignment 3.2R
This repository contains three functions which represent my answers to PIPS assignments 3.2.1 and 3.2.2. 

## remind_me()
This function takes no arguments. When called, it informs the user of a number of animals that hold high ranks in multiple militaries around the world. The output comes in form of a character vector. _It currently contians the names of 10 such animals._ 

## cheat()
The function cheat() takes one argument specifying which exercise from assignment 3.1. the user wants the answer to. Given the exercise number, the function tells the user the correct solution. _It currently works for exercises 5, 7 and 17._

## make_art()
This function only takes a seed number as input. It returns an artwork in the form of an animated plot. The work is titled "The Fly". The make_art function generates a blue plane (the sky), with a black dot (the fly) flying around the space. Setting the seed makes the artwork reproducible, instead of sampling new parameters every time.
